# Bitcoin Fractal CAT Examples  

This repository provides detailed examples of Bitcoin Fractal CAT token implementations, specifically for CAT20 and CAT721 tokens. These examples demonstrate how to create, manage, and interact with these token standards on the Bitcoin blockchain.

## Introduction

Bitcoin Fractal CAT (Contract-Assisted Tokens) is a framework for issuing and managing fungible and non-fungible tokens on Bitcoin. It enables tokenized assets to be created directly on the Bitcoin blockchain while maintaining security and decentralization.

## What is Bitcoin Fractal CAT?

Bitcoin Fractal CAT is an evolving token standard built on Bitcoin's UTXO model. It leverages contract-assisted transactions to enable token issuance, transfers, and management without requiring a separate smart contract platform.

## Token Standards

### CAT20 (Fungible Token)
CAT20 is a fungible token standard that allows the creation and transfer of tokenized assets similar to ERC-20 on Ethereum. Key features include:

- Fixed or dynamic supply
- Transferable between Bitcoin addresses
- Uses UTXO-based accounting

### CAT721 (Non-Fungible Token)
CAT721 is a non-fungible token (NFT) standard on Bitcoin, similar to ERC-721 on Ethereum. Each token is unique and indivisible, allowing the representation of digital assets like art, collectibles, and real-world assets.

- Unique token IDs
- Immutable metadata
- Ownership verification on Bitcoin

## Use Cases

Bitcoin Fractal CAT tokens enable various applications, including:

- **Tokenized Assets:** Represent real-world assets such as real estate and stocks.
- **Gaming:** In-game assets, rewards, and collectibles.
- **NFTs:** Digital art, music, and virtual goods.
- **Loyalty Programs:** Reward systems for businesses and platforms.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** Liquidity pools and staking mechanisms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To work with Bitcoin Fractal CAT tokens, ensure you have the following:

- A Bitcoin wallet that supports CAT transactions.
